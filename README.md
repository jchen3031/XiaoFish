Install TensorFlow
To reproduce our experiments, please install TensorFlow 2.0. The experiments can be reproduced on machines with or without GPUs. However, training with CPU only is extremely slow and we do not recommend it. Inference with CPU only is slow but tolerable.

We suggest following the official instructions to install the library. The code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 + CUDA 10.0 + CUDNN 7.6.3.
